    "generalRule": "The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand. Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end. If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand. If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack. Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.",
    "hit": "to ask for another card ",
    "stand": "to hold your total and end your turn.",
    "double": "doubling is like a hit, only the bet is doubled and you only get one more card. (You can only double/split on the first move, or first move of a hand created by a split.)",
    "split": "split can be done when you have two of the same card - the pair is split into two hands. Splitting also doubles the bet, because each new hand is worth the original bet. You cannot play on two aces after they are split.",
