  "title": "Nasty Dealer - BlackJack",
  "objective": "The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. Each player starts with two cards, the dealer will have one card hidden until their turn starts. Dealer will hit until 16, and stand on 17 or higher. You bust if you go over 21 and the dealer wins regardless of their hand.",
  "cardValues": "Numbered cards, 2 to 10, are worth their face values. Jacks, Queens and Kings are valued at 10. Aces can either have a value of 1 or 11, whichever is higher without the hand going over 21.",
  "bet": "You must place your bet before each hand. You can clear and set your bet by clicking on the corresponding chip(s).",
  "blackjack": "If your first 2 cards dealt are 21 (Ace & 10 or a picture card), you got blackjack.",
  "hit": "Draw another card.",
  "stand": "End your turn.",
  "push": "If both the player and dealer hands are the same value, result is a tie. The player's bet is returned.",
  "double": "Your bet is doubled, you only draw one more card and end your turn. Doubling is only available at the start of your hand after the cards have been dealt, this also applies to each split hand.",
  "split": "If you have two of the same card, you can only split the pair into two separate hands. You are required to make same original bet for the new split hand.",
  "surrender": "At the start of your turn, you may chose to surrender and have half your bet returned and the other half forfeited to the dealer.",
  "insurance": "If dealer's face up card is an Ace, you may opt to buy insurance (same value as original bet). You get paid 2 to 1 if dealer has BlackJack, otherwise, the insurance bet is forfeited."
